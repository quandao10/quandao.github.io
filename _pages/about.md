I am a Research Resident under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/anhttranusc/'>Dr. Tuan Anh Tran</a> at <a href='https://www.vinai.io/'>VinAI Research, Vietnam</a>. Besides, I also work closely with <a href='https://tbng.github.io/'>Dr. Nguyen Tuan Binh</a> at Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore. I received a bachelor degree in computer science from Monash University in 2020.

My research interests lie on deep generative model such as GAN, Diffusion and Flow Matching. Besides, I'm also interested in Neural Operator design space which allows models work well under any resolution.
